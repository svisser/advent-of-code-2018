Advent of Code 2018 solutions
=============================

Learning Rust by solving Advent of Code 2018 problems.

I have annotated variables with their types to see what's going on.

To run:

```
cargo run --bin adventXX
```

For example:

```
cargo run --bin advent01
```

A filepath can be passed for some solutions:

```
cargo run --bin advent03 -- src/03/input.txt
```
